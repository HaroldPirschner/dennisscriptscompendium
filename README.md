gitoverview
===========

A simple bash script that provides an overview of local changes in multiple checked out repositories

Since most programmers have multiple repositories that sometimes need to be worked on in parallel, one may loose the overview of which repositories have local changes.
With this short bash script you can check all local changes in either the subfolders of a specific directory, e.g. your workspace, or even recursivly into all subfolders.
By default only GIT repositories are checked, but SVN can also be looked up.

Call the script with -h to display its usage.
